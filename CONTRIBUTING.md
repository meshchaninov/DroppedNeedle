# Contributing to DroppedNeedle

Thanks for your interest. Bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests are all welcome.

## Reporting Bugs

Use the [bug report template](https://github.com/DroppedNeedle/DroppedNeedle/issues/new?template=bug.yml). Include your DroppedNeedle version, steps to reproduce, and relevant logs from `docker compose logs droppedneedle`. The more detail you give, the faster things get fixed.

## Requesting Features

Use the [feature request template](https://github.com/DroppedNeedle/DroppedNeedle/issues/new?template=feature.yml). Check existing issues first to avoid duplicates.

## Development Setup

The backend is Python 3.13 with FastAPI. The frontend is SvelteKit with Svelte 5, Tailwind CSS, and daisyUI.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10+
- Docker (for building the full image)

### Running Locally

The recommended setup creates local environment files from the checked-in examples and
installs both dependency sets. It never overwrites an existing environment file.

```bash
make doctor
make setup
make dev
```

This starts the backend at `http://localhost:8688` and prints the Vite frontend URL.
Press Ctrl-C once to stop both processes. To run either side separately:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && .venv/bin/uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8688

# Frontend (in another terminal)
cd frontend && pnpm run dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
make backend-test    # backend suite
make frontend-test   # frontend suite
make test            # both
make check           # fast lint, types, formatting, and server-side frontend tests
make ci              # full local CI-equivalent gate
```

Frontend browser tests use Playwright. Install the browser first:

```bash
make frontend-browser-install
```

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Give your branch a descriptive name: `fix-scrobble-timing`, `feature-playlist-export`, etc.
3. If you're fixing a bug, mention the issue number in the PR description.
4. Make sure tests pass before submitting.
5. Keep changes focused. One PR per fix or feature.

## Code Style

- Backend: strong typing, async/await, no blocking I/O in async contexts.
- Frontend: strict TypeScript, no `any`. Named exports. Async/await only.
- Use existing design tokens (`primary`, `secondary`, etc.) for colours, not hardcoded values.
- Run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run check` in the frontend before submitting.

## AI-Assisted Contributions

If you used AI tools (Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to write code in your PR, please mention it. This isn't a problem and won't get your PR rejected, but it helps reviewers calibrate how much scrutiny to apply. A quick note like "Claude helped with the caching logic" is enough.

You're still responsible for understanding and testing the code you submit.
