"""Audio quality tiers for download preferences.

A single linear quality axis: lossless (FLAC/ALAC/...) at the top, then lossy
bitrate bands. The bands are CODEC-AGNOSTIC - MP3, AAC/M4A, OGG and Opus are all
classified by bitrate - because cross-codec bitrate isn't apples-to-apples but is
good enough at this granularity. The download-client quality range
(``quality_min``..``quality_max``) accepts a contiguous band; the scorer/matcher
then prefer the highest available tier ABSOLUTELY. ``flac_mp3_only`` (default on)
restricts acceptable formats to FLAC + MP3.

NOTE: ``TIER_KEYS`` is mirrored in ``DownloadClientConnectionSettings.__post_init__``
(api/v1/schemas/settings.py) for validation - keep them in sync.
