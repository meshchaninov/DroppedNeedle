"""Guardrail 1: DroppedNeedle ships no source that indexes infringing content.

The user supplies every *acquisition* source the app can reach - their own slskd
instance, or their own Newznab indexers and their own SABnzbd. No indexer, tracker,
or P2P server is preset, bundled, recommended, or curated in-tree.

Free Music (D24) is the deliberate default exception: it ships archive.org preset
and offers only items with an explicit open licence. The optional YouTube
provisional lane is disabled by default, searches only public videos without
cookies, and leaves the rights decision with the operator. Bundling specialised
means of *finding infringing content* is what this guardrail prevents. The tests
below pin the forbidden-domain boundary and Free Music's open-licence filter.

This is the load-bearing distinction between an automation tool and an index, and
the README's "Legality boundary" section asserts it in prose. It held until now
because we remembered it. This test makes CI remember instead.

Scope: shipped source only. ``backend/tests/`` is exempt because the Newznab
mock in ``tests/mocks/`` is the executable record of live-verified indexer
behaviour and is *named after* the real services it was captured from - that is
the house pattern for stateful integrations, not a bundled source.
