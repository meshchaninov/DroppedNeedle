"""Download manifest - DroppedNeedle-side crash-recovery + correlation state (Phase 7).

slskd has no batch id and no per-request ``externalId`` (C2): a task is tied to
its slskd transfers only by ``source_username`` plus the exact set of filenames it
enqueued. The manifest persists that pair (plus the album metadata the importer
needs) to ``staging/{task_id}/manifest.json`` at enqueue time, so a restart can
re-correlate the task to its transfers and finish the import.

The audio is NOT staged here - slskd writes completed files into its own
``directories.downloads`` (C4); staging holds only this manifest. ``ManifestCodec``
round-trips the struct through ``msgspec.json`` (a plain file, not a DB blob - so
AUD-9's house-codec rule for blob columns does not apply).
